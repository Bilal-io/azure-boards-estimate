## Starting a new session

1.  Start a new session from the backlog context menu or use the *Estimate* hub and select an iteration
2.  Share the generated link with your team members, so that they are able to join
3.  Once all members have joined, everyone picks a card
4.  After everyone has picked a card, click `Reveal` to reveal everyone's estimate
5.  Select and commit the final estimate
